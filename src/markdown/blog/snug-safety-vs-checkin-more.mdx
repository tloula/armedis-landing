Snug Safety is a popular check-in app. CheckIn More is a new family-run check-in app. Here are a few of the key differences between the two.

## 1. Pricing

Snug Safety has a completely free plan, but it only allows one check-in per day. The paid plan is $19.99 / month and unlocks up to 3 daily check-ins and phone-calls for missed check-ins.

As a small family-run business, CheckIn More unfortunately cannot currently offer a completely free plan. However, our plan has a two-week free trial and is only $6.99 / month and includes unlimited daily check-ins.

## 2. Location Tracking

Snug Safety requires you to grant them access to your location in order for the app to function. If you miss a check-in, Snug sends your location to your contacts and their dispatch service.

CheckIn More does not have location tracking. While supporting location sharing in case of an emergency is on our roadmap, we won't make it a requirement for the app to function.

## 3. Check-In Schedule

Snug only allows daily check-ins at a specific time.

CheckIn More allows you to configure your check-ins similar to how you can configure your phone's alarms. You can create as many as you would like. You choose the day of the week, the time, and the duration of the check-in window for each one.

## 4. Check-In Style

Snug only has one check-in option: a one-tap check-in.

CheckIn More has a variety of check-in options: one-tap, mood status, request assistance, or a combination of them.

## 5. Dispatch Service

If you miss a check-in, Snug has a dispatch service that will call you, then your contacts, then request a wellness check to your last-known location.

CheckIn More does not currently have have a dispatch service like this.

## Conclusion

Both apps are great options for staying connected with loved ones. Hopefully this helps give you a quick overview of the key differences between the two.
