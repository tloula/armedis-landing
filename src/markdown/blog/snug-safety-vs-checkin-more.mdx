## The Key Differences

### <Icon name="circle-dollar-sign" /> Price

Snug's free plan is genuinely free — one check-in per day, basic contact alerts. The Dispatch plan runs $19.99/month and adds professional emergency dispatch.

CheckIn More is $6.99/month with a 14-day free trial (no credit card). That includes unlimited check-ins, unlimited contacts, and full scheduling control.

### <Icon name="calendar" /> Scheduling

Snug lets you set one check-in time, daily. That's it.

CheckIn More works more like your phone's alarm app — you can set multiple check-ins per day, different times for different days, and a custom window before contacts are notified. You can also pause check-ins for travel without canceling your account.

### <Icon name="smartphone" /> Check-In Methods

Snug has one check-in option: tap the green checkmark.

CheckIn More has four: one-tap, mood status, request assistance, or a combination. The mood and assistance options give your contacts more context — not just "I checked in," but how you're actually doing.

### <Icon name="map-pin" /> Location Tracking

Snug requires "always on" location permissions. Your location is shared with contacts and Snug's dispatch service if you miss a check-in.

CheckIn More doesn't request location permissions at all. The app is built around scheduled check-ins, not location monitoring.

### <Icon name="shield" /> Dispatch Service

This is Snug's clearest advantage. The Dispatch plan includes a human dispatcher who calls you when you miss a check-in — and if needed, can request an emergency wellness check to your last known location.

CheckIn More doesn't have a dispatch service. Missed check-ins alert your personal contacts by text, with AI voice calls to contacts coming soon. For most people, that's sufficient — but if professional dispatch is a hard requirement, Snug's Dispatch plan is worth the price.

## Which One Is Right for You?

**Choose CheckIn More if** you want flexible scheduling, multiple daily check-ins, mood tracking, no location tracking, and a lower price.

**Choose Snug's Dispatch plan if** you specifically need a professional dispatcher who can escalate to emergency services on your behalf.

**Snug's free plan** is a reasonable starting point if one daily check-in at a fixed time is all you need.
