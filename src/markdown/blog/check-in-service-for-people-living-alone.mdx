I've seen it happen many times now - kids grow up, move out, and start building their own lives. Sometimes they find roommates or a partner, but often they choose to live on their own.

For parents, that independence comes with a new kind of worry: is no news really good news? A missed call or unanswered text can spiral into concern. But at the same time, calling or texting every day just to "check in" can feel overbearing - especially for young adults who are craving independence.

This is one of the reasons why I built CheckIn More. It's a check-in service for people living alone that creates balance between safety and freedom.

Here's how it works:

- The person living alone sets up daily check-ins at times that make sense for their routine.
- Parents or loved ones can choose how often they want to be notified:
  - Every check-in completed (extra reassurance)
  - Only missed check-ins (the "no news is good news" approach)

This way, independence isn't sacrificed - and peace of mind is built right in.

As a developer (and someone who's been both the worried loved one and the independent young adult), I wanted a solution that felt respectful. CheckIn More removes the pressure of constant texts and calls while making sure everyone stays connected when it really matters.
