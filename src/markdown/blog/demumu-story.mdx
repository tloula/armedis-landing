In June 2025, three developers at a small company called Moonscape Technologies in Zhengzhou, China spent about **1,500 yuan** — roughly $210 — building an app. It sat quietly in the App Store for months.

Then, in January 2026, it became the #1 paid app in China. Within days, it was topping charts in the US, UK, Canada, and Australia. Sixty investors came knocking. A 10% stake reportedly jumped from 1 million yuan to nearly 10 million yuan in three days.

The app's name: *Sǐ le ma.* **"Are you dead?"**

## <Icon name="lightbulb" /> The Idea Was Absurdly Simple

The app does almost nothing. You open it once a day and tap a button to confirm you're okay. If you don't tap for a couple of days, it sends an email to up to two emergency contacts you've designated. No account. No subscription. No tracking. Just a button, and a backup plan.

The developers — all born after 1995 — weren't trying to build a business. They were solving a problem they saw around them: in a country with 125 million single-person households, what happens when something goes wrong and nobody notices?

## <Icon name="megaphone" /> The Name That Launched a Thousand Headlines

The original Chinese name was a deliberate provocation. *Sǐ le ma* riffs on *Ē le ma* — "Are you hungry?" — the slogan of China's biggest food delivery platform. Same cadence, darker question.

It was uncomfortable. That was the point.

On Weibo, when the team announced they'd rename the app *Demumu* for global launch, users pushed back hard. One wrote: *"Maybe some conservative people can't accept it, but it is helpful for safety purposes. It will make us unmarried people feel more at ease to spend our lives."*

The bluntness wasn't a bug. It was the product.

## <Icon name="heart" /> Why It Hit So Hard

The dark humor got the clicks. But the reason people actually downloaded it — and kept it — was something quieter.

A 57-year-old former IT analyst in Texas described his daily check-in routine: feed the cat, tidy up, then tap the button. *"It's kind of nice,"* he said. *"It's almost like someone cares."*

That quote — from a man who has people in his life, who isn't in crisis, who is simply living alone in modern America — explains everything. The app didn't go viral because it was technically impressive. It went viral because it named a fear that millions of people carry around and never say out loud.

## <Icon name="trending-up" /> The Wave That Followed

Within days of going viral, Demumu had inspired dozens of copycat apps. Investors flooded in. The category — quiet, underserved, slightly morbid — suddenly had everyone's attention.

It also sparked a broader conversation: check-in apps aren't just for the elderly. The primary demographic for these tools spans students, remote workers, solo travelers, and young adults living independently. Japan's government data showed over 1,000 people **under 40** died alone at home in 2024, discovered more than eight days later.

The fear Demumu addressed isn't a senior issue. It's a modern life issue.

Demumu proved something important: people want a simple, non-intrusive safety net. Not a medical device. Not a subscription service with a call center. Just a quiet app that asks a simple question every day, and notices if you stop answering.

That need existed long before Demumu. It'll exist long after.

## <Icon name="rocket" /> CheckIn More: Built on the Same Idea, Taken Further

We started CheckIn More for the same reason the Demumu team built their app — because people living alone deserve a simple way to let someone know they're okay, and to know someone will notice if they're not.

We've taken the concept further: SMS text alerts (not just email), unlimited contacts, flexible scheduling, mood check-ins, an assistance button, and Android support. Same core promise — more ways to make it work for your actual life.
