If you've seen coverage of **Demumu** — the viral Chinese app formerly known as "Are You Dead?" — you're probably thinking about what it would mean to have a daily safety net running in the background. That instinct is right. But Demumu has real limitations, especially for users outside China who want something more robust.

Here's how **CheckIn More** compares.

## <Icon name="thumbs-up" /> What Demumu Gets Right

Demumu deserves credit for making a simple, uncomfortable idea go viral. The core insight — that when you live alone, there's often no natural signal if something goes wrong — is exactly right. Its stripped-back design (no account, no subscription, one button) made it approachable for millions of people who'd never thought about a safety check-in app before.

But simplicity has a ceiling.

## <Icon name="triangle-alert" /> Where Demumu Falls Short

### <Icon name="smartphone" /> iOS Only — Android Users Are Left Out

Demumu is only available on Apple's App Store. If you or your emergency contact uses an Android device, you're out of luck. CheckIn More is available on both iOS and Android.

### <Icon name="mail" /> Email Alerts Aren't Urgent Enough

When Demumu detects a missed check-in, it sends an **email** to your emergency contact. Email gets ignored. Email goes to spam. Email doesn't wake anyone up at night. CheckIn More sends **SMS text alerts** — the format people actually respond to.

### <Icon name="users" /> Only Two Emergency Contacts

Demumu allows up to two emergency contacts. CheckIn More lets you add **unlimited contacts** and customize exactly which alerts each person receives.

### <Icon name="calendar" /> No Schedule Control

Demumu checks in daily. That's it. CheckIn More lets you set check-in times by day of the week, run multiple check-ins per day, and adjust the window before an alert fires.

### <Icon name="globe" /> Built for China, Not for You

Demumu was built quickly for a Chinese audience and is only now attempting a global rollout. CheckIn More was built from day one for the US market — with US-based, founder-led support.

## <Icon name="rocket" /> How CheckIn More Goes Further

### <Icon name="smartphone" /> Four Check-in Options

| Check-in Method | What It Tells Your Contacts |
|---|---|
| **One-tap check-in** | "I'm okay" |
| **Mood status** | How you're actually feeling today |
| **Request assistance** | "I need help" — triggers an alert immediately |
| **Combo check-in** | Check in + share your mood at once |

Demumu offers one method: tap a button every two days.

### <Icon name="bell" /> Contacts Get Texts, Not Emails

Your loved ones receive **SMS text messages** — for completed check-ins, missed check-ins, and assistance requests. No app download, no account, no digging through spam.

### <Icon name="calendar" /> Scheduling That Fits Real Life

- Different check-in times for different days of the week
- Multiple check-ins per day if you want them
- Flexible check-in windows so a short delay doesn't fire a false alarm
- Easy pause for vacations or travel

### <Icon name="handshake" /> A Team That Answers the Phone

CheckIn More is built by a husband-and-wife team. When something isn't working, you're talking to the founders — not a support queue.

## <Icon name="banknote" /> Pricing

| | CheckIn More | Demumu |
|---|---|---|
| Cost | $6.99/month | ~$0.99 one-time |
| Free trial | 14 days | No |
| Android | <Yes /> | <No /> |
| SMS alerts | <Yes /> | <No /> |
| Unlimited contacts | <Yes /> | <No /> |
| Custom schedule | <Yes /> | <No /> |

Demumu is cheaper upfront. But a one-time purchase with email-only alerts and no Android support isn't the right tool for a real safety net. CheckIn More is built to actually work when it matters.

CheckIn More is the right choice if you:

- Use Android, or have contacts who do
- Want your family notified by **text**, not email
- Need more than one emergency contact
- Want to check in more than once a day, or on a custom schedule
- Want to share your mood — not just "still alive"
