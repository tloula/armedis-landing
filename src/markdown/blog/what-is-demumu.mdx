In January 2026, a tiny app built by three developers for around $210 became one of the most downloaded paid apps in China — and then the world. Its name: **"Are You Dead?"**

You've probably seen the headlines. Here's everything you need to know about Demumu, why it went viral, and what it says about the way millions of people are living today.

## <Icon name="info" /> What Is Demumu?

Demumu (known in Chinese as *Sǐ le ma* — literally "Are you dead?") is a daily safety check-in app built for people who live alone. The concept is brutally simple:

1. Open the app once a day and tap a button to confirm you're okay
2. If you miss too many check-ins, the app automatically alerts your emergency contact
3. That's it

No wearables. No GPS. No subscription. Just a quiet digital nudge — and a backup plan if you don't respond.

## <Icon name="users" /> Who Made It?

Demumu was built by a three-person team at Moonscape Technologies, a small company based in Zhengzhou, China. The developers — all born after 1995 — spent roughly 1,500 yuan (about $210) to build the first version. It launched quietly in mid-2025 and barely registered — until January 2026, when it exploded.

## <Icon name="trending-up" /> Why Did It Go Viral?

Two things collided at once: a name that made people stop scrolling, and a fear that a lot of people quietly share.

The original Chinese name (*Sǐ le ma*) is a dark riff on the food delivery app *Ē le ma* ("Are you hungry?"). The dark humor made it shareable. But the reason people *kept* it on their phones wasn't the joke — it was the premise.

As one 57-year-old user in Texas put it: *"It's kind of nice. It's almost like someone cares."*

That quote captures everything. The app went viral because loneliness and the fear of dying undiscovered — not just among the elderly, but among young professionals, remote workers, and single adults of all ages — is more common than anyone admits out loud.

## <Icon name="chart-bar" /> The Numbers Behind the Fear

This isn't a niche concern. The scale of solo living is enormous and growing:

- **125 million** one-person households in China as of 2020 — one in four households
- **200 million** projected by 2030
- **76,000** people living alone died at home in Japan in 2024 — with over 1,000 of them under 40
- In the US, the share of single-person households has more than doubled since the 1960s

The fear Demumu addresses isn't irrational. It's a reasonable response to a real structural gap: when you live alone, there is often no one who would notice for days if something went wrong.

## <Icon name="zap" /> What Happened After It Went Viral?

The numbers were staggering. Within days of going viral:

- Daily new users reached **500x** pre-viral levels
- The app hit the **#1 paid app** spot on China's App Store
- More than **60 investors** approached the team
- The app expanded to **40+ countries**, reaching top charts in the US, UK, Canada, and Australia
- Dozens of copycat apps flooded the market almost immediately

The developers renamed the app **Demumu** for global launch — a softer name, though many users on Weibo pushed back, preferring the blunt original.

## <Icon name="thumbs-up" /> What Demumu Does Well

- <Icon name="check-circle" /> **Radical simplicity** — no account, no subscription, one button
- <Icon name="check-circle" /> **Low friction** — download and set up in under two minutes
- <Icon name="check-circle" /> **No tracking** — unlike some safety apps, it doesn't collect location data
- <Icon name="check-circle" /> **Affordable** — a one-time fee of roughly $0.99

## <Icon name="triangle-alert" /> Where Demumu Has Limits

For a first version built in days for $210, Demumu is impressive. But it has real gaps — especially for users outside China:

- <Icon name="x-circle" /> **iOS only** — no Android support
- <Icon name="x-circle" /> **Email alerts only** — not SMS, which is far less reliable for urgent situations
- <Icon name="x-circle" /> **Two emergency contacts maximum**
- <Icon name="x-circle" /> **No schedule customization** — checks in every 48 hours, nothing more
- <Icon name="x-circle" /> **No mood or wellness context** — it's alive/not-alive, nothing in between
- <Icon name="x-circle" /> **No assistance button** — you can't proactively signal that you need help

## <Icon name="lightbulb" /> What Demumu Proves

The viral moment matters beyond one app. It revealed that there's a massive, underserved population of people living alone who want a simple, non-intrusive way to let someone know they're okay — and to know that someone will notice if they're not.

That need is real. And it's not going away.

## <Icon name="arrow-right-circle" /> Looking for a Demumu Alternative?

If you're on Android, or want SMS alerts, multiple contacts, and flexible scheduling, **CheckIn More** was built for exactly this. Same core idea — daily check-ins, instant alerts if you miss one — with more control and a US-based team behind it.
