As the developer behind CheckIn More, this idea started from something I noticed in my own family: seniors often reach a stage where they're too independent to move into senior living, but not quite independent enough to be left entirely on their own.

At that stage, family members often feel a responsibility to check in every day. A quick call or text turns into a routine: "Do you need anything today?" These daily check-ins come from love - but when they happen out of obligation, they can quickly feel like a chore for everyone involved.

That's why I built CheckIn More. It's a daily check-in app for seniors designed to reduce pressure on families while still keeping seniors safe and supported.

Instead of requiring constant texts or calls, the app sends a simple notification to your loved one at the times you choose. All they need to do is check in with a quick tap. If they miss a check-in, their trusted contacts get notified - so you know when it's actually important to reach out.

The result:

- Peace of mind for family members, without the guilt of missing a call.
- Independence for seniors, who don't feel "hovered over."
- Meaningful communication when you do connect, because conversations aren't limited to daily status updates.

For me, this project is about making technology feel more human. A simple daily check-in shouldn't take away from real connection - it should support it.

If you've been searching for a daily check in app for seniors that balances safety and independence, I built CheckIn More with exactly that in mind.
