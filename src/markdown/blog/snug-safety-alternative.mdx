## Why People Search for Snug Safety Alternatives

Snug Safety is a well-known wellness check-in app, and it's genuinely helped many people feel safer living alone. But users often start looking for alternatives when they run into these common friction points:

- **Limited flexibility** — Snug only lets you adjust your check-in time, nothing else
- **Single daily check-in** — on the free plan, you're locked to once per day
- **Price jump** — the free plan is basic; the full Dispatch plan costs $19.99/month
- **Location tracking concerns** — Snug requires "always on" location permissions
- **No mood or wellness context** — alerts go out, but there's no way to signal how you're actually feeling

That's exactly the gap CheckIn More was designed to fill.

## How CheckIn More Is Different

### 1. <Icon name="circle-dollar-sign" /> One Simple Price, Unlimited Check-ins

CheckIn More has a single plan at **$6.99/month** — no tiers, no hidden upgrades.

For that price you get:
- Unlimited check-in times per day
- Unlimited contacts notified by text
- Customizable schedules by day of week
- Adjustable check-in windows
- A 14-day free trial (no credit card required)

Compare that to Snug's Dispatch plan at $19.99/month, and you're saving **$156 every year** — for a more flexible product.

### 2. <Icon name="calendar" /> Scheduling That Actually Fits Your Life

One of the biggest differentiators is schedule flexibility. Snug lets you pick your check-in time — that's it.

CheckIn More lets you:
- Set **different check-in times** for different days of the week
- Enable **multiple check-ins per day** (morning and evening, for example)
- Choose a **flexible check-in window** — so you can choose exactly how long you have to check in before your contacts are notified
- **Pause check-ins** for vacations or appointments without canceling your account

This level of control matters. Life isn't a fixed schedule.

### 3. <Icon name="smartphone" /> Four Ways to Check In

When it's time to check in, CheckIn More gives you options that go beyond a simple tap:

| Check-in Method | What It Tells Your Contacts |
|---|---|
| **One-tap check-in** | "I'm okay" |
| **Mood status** | How you're actually feeling today |
| **Request assistance** | "I need help" — triggers an alert immediately |
| **Combo check-in** | Check in + share your mood at once |

Snug offers a single check-in method: tap the green checkmark. That's fine for a basic confirm, but CheckIn More gives your loved ones a fuller picture of how you're doing.

### 4. <Icon name="users" /> Contacts Stay Informed Without Downloading Anything

Your family and friends don't need to install an app or create an account. They simply receive **text message updates** whenever you:

- <Yes /> Complete a check-in
- <Warn /> Miss a check-in window
- <SOS /> Request assistance
- <Phone /> **AI phone call on missed check-in** *(Coming Soon)*
- <Phone /> **AI phone call on anomalous missed check-in** *(Coming Soon)*

You can add **unlimited contacts** and customize exactly which alerts each person receives. A spouse might want every notification; an adult child might only want to know if you miss a check-in.

### 5. <Icon name="handshake" /> A Business That Actually Knows Your Name

CheckIn More is built by a husband-and-wife team. When you email support, you're talking to the founders — not an offshore support ticket queue.

That matters in this category. A wellness check-in app should feel like it comes from people who care, not a faceless corporation. Every feature update is shaped by direct user feedback, and the team is responsive by design — not by policy.

## <Icon name="banknote" /> Pricing Breakdown: 3-Year Cost Comparison

| | CheckIn More | Snug (Free) | Snug (Dispatch) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Monthly cost | $6.99 | $0 | $19.99 |
| Annual cost | $83.88 | $0 | $239.88 |
| 3-year total | **$251.64** | $0 | **$719.64** |
| Check-ins per day | Unlimited | 1 | 1 |
| Mood tracking | <Yes /> | <No /> | <No /> |
| Custom schedule | <Yes /> | <No /> | <No /> |

> Snug's free plan is worth considering if one daily check-in is enough. But if you want more flexibility, mood context, or multiple daily check-ins, CheckIn More delivers more value at a fraction of Snug's paid price.

## Who Is CheckIn More Best For?

CheckIn More is a great fit if you or your loved one:

- **Lives alone** and wants a simple, reliable daily safety net
- **Has family members** who want to stay informed without downloading another app
- **Values flexibility** — different check-in times on different days, or multiple times per day
- **Wants to share more than "I'm okay"** — mood status and assistance requests add meaningful context

---

## Who Might Prefer Snug Safety?

To give you a fair picture: Snug Safety's Dispatch plan is the right call if you specifically need a **human dispatcher** to call you and, if needed, send emergency services when you miss a check-in. CheckIn More currently alerts your personal contacts via text — though **AI voice calls to contacts on a missed check-in are coming soon**.

If professional emergency dispatch is the top priority, Snug's Dispatch plan offers something CheckIn More doesn't yet. For everyone else, CheckIn More is the stronger, more affordable, and more flexible option — and getting even better.
